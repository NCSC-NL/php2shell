## TLP:CLEAR

This repository contains operational information regarding the critical PHP vulnerabilities tracked by CERT-EU as CVE-2026-109618 and CVE-2026-109619.

PHP is a widely used open-source server-side scripting language, so these vulnerabilities may affect a broad range of internet-facing web applications and products that embed or depend on PHP.

## Current status

On 21 October 2026, PHP published fixed releases for CVE-2026-109618 and CVE-2026-109619: PHP 8.5.12, 8.4.27, 8.3.36 and 8.2.35. PHP states that both vulnerabilities can allow unauthenticated remote code execution and that all PHP installations serving web requests are at risk, including PHP-FPM, Apache with mod_php, php-cgi, FrankenPHP and LiteSpeed. PHP considers the risk highest for mod_php, where an unauthenticated request can trigger exploitation before application code runs.

PHP describes CVE-2026-109618 as remote code execution via out-of-memory corruption during request cleanup, and CVE-2026-109619 as remote code execution via stale request-owned global state reused by a later request on the same worker. PHP 8.1 and older are no longer supported by the PHP project; distributions and LTS vendors may provide backported packages, and PHP has published minimal source backports for PHP 7.4, 8.0 and 8.1.

The impact is not limited to websites: PHP is also embedded in appliances, network devices, management interfaces and other vendor products where administrators may not be able to update PHP directly.

## Recommended actions

- Identify PHP-based applications and their runtime versions, with priority on internet-facing systems and web-serving SAPIs.
- Update to PHP 8.5.12, 8.4.27, 8.3.36 or 8.2.35, or apply vendor-provided backported packages.
- Check third-party images, appliances and embedded runtimes separately; for products that bundle PHP, apply vendor updates as soon as they become available.
- If immediate patching is not possible, follow PHP's temporary mitigations, including disabling `session.upload_progress`, restarting workers, and reviewing the official `memory_limit`, `post_max_size` and PHP 8.5 `fatal_error_backtraces` guidance. PHP states that these measures are not complete fixes.
- Monitor vendor advisories, internet-facing logs, and public exploit activity.

For updates to the software list: our strong preference is to receive edits in the SPDX source files in `software/spdx/`. The Markdown list pages are generated automatically from those files. In case this proves too difficult: don't worry. We'll attempt to backport edits in the .md files to the SPDX source files, but without any guarantees.
